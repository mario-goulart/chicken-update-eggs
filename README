Usage: chicken-update-eggs.scm [<options>] <from prefix> <to prefix>

<from prefix> is the chicken installation prefix where to obtain the
egg list to install into <to prefix>

<options> are:

--dry-run
  only shows what is to be executed without actually executing it.

--skip-eggs=<eggs>
  don't attempt to install <eggs> (a comma-sparated list of eggs).

--skip-local-eggs
  don't attempt to install eggs which are not served by the egg
  server.

Example:

    $ chicken-update-eggs /usr/local/chicken-4.7.0 /usr/local/chicken-4.7.4

would install all eggs from /usr/local/chicken-4.7.0 into
/usr/local/chicken-4.7.4

This program can also be used to update all eggs if you give it the
same values for <from prefix> and <to prefix>.
