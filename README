Usage: chicken-update-eggs [ --dry-run ] <from prefix> <to prefix>

<from prefix> is the chicken installation prefix where to get the egg
list to install into <to prefix>.

Example:

  $ chicken-update-eggs /usr/local/chicken-4.7.0 /usr/local/chicken-4.7.4

would install all eggs from /usr/local/chicken-4.7.0 into
/usr/local/chicken-4.7.4

--dry-run (optional) only shows what is to be executed without
actually executing it.

This program can also be used to update all agg if you give it the
same values for <from prefix> and <to prefix>.
